##General Info
This was a fun anc challenging weather app I created using HTML, CSS, javaScript, and as well as a weather api and a map api. This app is fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing. The app displays the current weather of the selected city as well as a one week forecast. The app also features an autocomplete searchbar to make searching for a city a mich better user experience.
