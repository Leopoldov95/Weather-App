## General Info
This was a fun and challenging weather app I created using HTML, CSS, javaScript, and as well as a weather api and a map api. This app is fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing. The app displays the current weather of the selected city as well as a one week forecast. The app also features an autocomplete searchbar to make searching for a city a much better user experience.

## What I Learned
This was my larget project to date and as a result I was able to learn a lot about javaScript, handling HTTP requests, async code, and most importantly not being afraid to go into unkown and new territories of programming. I am aware that at the moment the source code is quite messy and definitely has room for refactoring.
